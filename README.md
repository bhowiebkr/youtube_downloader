# youtube_downloader

This tool will download the music from a single video or then entire channel. This uses the [youtube_dl](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/) library. Saved files will most likely be saved as **".webm"** as that was the original container on YouTube. Use a player like **VLC** to play the files after downloading from your Google Drive.
